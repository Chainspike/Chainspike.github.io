<P>When.</P>

<H2><A NAME="wmv9_vcm_release_notes_lwaq"></A>Knuckles</H2>
<p>Some data for Knuckles as a playable character seems to still exist in the 
game. Game Genie codes <b>ASCA-AAHC</b> <b>ASCA-BA9Y </b>or Patch Code <b>
FFEF4C:0003</b> will allow you to &quot;select&quot; Knuckles as your character. You will 
play as Sonic, but have Knuckles' character select, continue icons, and 
&quot;level-clearing&quot; text. The end signpost will also feature Knuckles, though the 
image uses Sonic's blue palette, and the markers on the score screens that 
appear after a Special Stage use Knuckles' palette. As you might expect, this 
code will save properly, allowing you to apply the code, create a save, then 
continue to use &quot;Knuckles&quot; even without the Game Genie.<br>
<br>
<b>FFFA80:0101</b> makes a few bosses behave like Knuckles' versions: Fire 
breath shoots missiles, Robotnik doesn't fly down when he creates the water 
spout in Hydrocity, the spiked cylinder is in the Tunnelbot battle, and the 
second boss in Launch Base Act 2 plays a broken version of Knuckles' bomb 
cutscene when you defeat it (the bomb that should fly out of the wreckage 
appears with glitched graphics). This suggests that Knuckles was not meant to 
fight Big Arms at this point in development and was meant to go straight to 
Mushroom Valley/Hill Zone, or even that Big Arms wasn't originally intended to 
be in the game at all. After this cutscene plays, nothing else happens. The game 
crashes some time after the cutscene for unknown reasons. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<img border="0" src="KnucklesInSonic3Alone2.png" width="320" height="224"></p>
<p>The cut-scene where Sonic arrives on Angel Island is glitched. The cutscene 
starts where Knuckles would normally start in the level. For some reason the 
fire-bombing cutscene starts while the glitched intro is going on and Sonic can 
fall through the ground and die.</p>
<p>The Insta-Shield graphics disappear at times.</p>
<p>The cut-scene at the beginning of Ice Cap Act 1 is the same as Tails'.</p>
<p>The pit at the beginning of Ice Cap Act 1 doesn't work correctly; the part 
where the bottom of the stage should connect to the top instead acts like a 
bottomless pit, causing you to lose a life.</p>
<p>In Launch Base Act 1, the cut-scene where Knuckles throws a bomb works, but 
the building does not load. This is because when you play as Knuckles in Sonic 3 
&amp; Knuckles, the building is already destroyed and the game simply does not load 
it.</p>
<p>The game soft-locks after defeating the Launch Base Act 1 boss. Sonic can 
still be controlled, but nothing else will happen. This is because Knuckles was 
supposed to fight two of them.</p>
<p>If you use the last code mentioned above and break the rocks leading to 
Knuckles's boss arena, the water will lower (As it does for Knuckles), but the 
screenlock will not lower sometimes and prevent you for continuing.</p>
<p>Although there is no boss in the Knuckles area in Angel Island, there are 
three hidden end-of-act monitors in place: one each of Thunder Shield, Aqua 
Shield and 10 Rings. Obviously, since there is no mini-boss to defeat and no 
signpost to uncover them with, they are completely inaccessible. These monitors 
are present in<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i style="image-rendering: pixelated;">Sonic 
3 &amp; Knuckles</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>with the same items.</p>
